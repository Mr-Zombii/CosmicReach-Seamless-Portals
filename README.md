This mod adds portals to the game of Cosmic Reach.

The mod has both stationary portals made using the Portal Generator and portals more akin to those seen in the game "Portal", made with the Handheld Portal Generator (HPG).

## Omnium

Omnium is the main material of the mod. It is a white crystal that grows in places where the fabric of reality is especially thin.

Omnium ore can be found below y = -32 in clusters of up to 5 blocks, each block dropping from 1 to 5 crystal shards. It is quite rare.

 Two omnium crystals can be calibrated inside an omnium calibrator, which links them together.

## Portal generator and spacial anchor

Portal generator can create stationary portals. It works in conjunction with a spacial anchor.

You need to place 2 calibrated omnium crystals of the same frequency in a spacial anchor and a portal generator to link them together and then activate the portal generator, which will create a portal connecting the two.

You can adjust the size and position of the portals from the generator.

## Handheld portal generator (HPG)

This works exactly like the portal gun from the famous "Portal" game series.

Left click fires the blue portal, right click fires the orange portal, middle click destroys any fired portals.

Note: Every HPG has its own set of portals.

The portals produced by the HPG are inherently less stable than those produced by the normal portal generator, so they require a surface to rest on.
Portals can be placed on any surface except for the Portal Repulsor blocks.

## Unstable HPG
![Unstable HPG](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ab50a86-6fc5-41e1-8f69-9be11707d0de)

Works just like the normal HPG, but its portals are even less stable and thus require a special type of surface to stay open. Its portals can only be placed on Omnium blocks and Portal Conductor blocks.

This is useful for map making.
